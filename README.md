# BashGmail

### This script will allow you to send emails from the terminal after you have set up a project on google cloud and have enabled gmail's api.
Once you provision the script with a refresh token, your client ID and client secret, it is ready to be used.

Go through these steps:
- Edit the email_body.txt file with the message you want to send.
- Open the script and edit the subject of the email to your liking and choose the source and the destination email(s).  
- Then you can run the script.

Note: This script requires jq to be installed. 

On Mac OS run <code> brew install jq </code>


On Ubuntu run code <code> sudo apt install jq </code>
